## **Rock vs Mine | Machine Learning**  
### **Rock Mine Prediction**  

In this project, we developed a **Machine Learning model** to classify whether a given object is a **rock or a mine** based on provided data.  

We utilized the **scikit-learn (sklearn)** library and implemented **Logistic Regression** for model training. Logistic Regression is a powerful classification algorithm that helps distinguish between rock and mine based on labeled data.  

### **Key Features:**  
✅ **Supervised Learning Approach** – Trained on labeled data for accurate predictions.  
✅ **Logistic Regression Model** – A simple yet effective classification technique.  
✅ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Ensuring high model accuracy.  
✅ **Python & Scikit-learn Implementation** – Leveraging standard ML libraries.  

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to classify objects based on structured data.
